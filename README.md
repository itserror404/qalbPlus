A web application prototype bringing patients and doctors together in the region of United Arab Emirates. The project is written in the Django framework. This work was a group project done for my Software Engineering Course taught by the fantastic Professor Mai Oudah(https://github.com/Mai-Oudah). I am also indebted to my brilliant team members, Ali Jafri(https://github.com/AliAbdullah0314), Maimuna Zaheer(https://github.com/itserror404), Shamma Alkhoori(https://github.com/Shamma-Alkhoori), and Saoud Al Mansoori(https://github.com/dhabibit). It goes without saying I would have had fared far worse without their effort and collaboration.

My specific contributions were: 
- Writing the system request and typsetting in Latex
- Authoring many of the planning documentations
- Designing the class diagrams and one of the sequence diagrams
- Coding the credentials application that uploads files to the web application.
